# FLOW SCENE BUILDER

- This is a scene builder tool that merge houdini with Flow/Shotgun/Shotgrid.
- With it the user not need enter to Flow to get the initial steps to work in his tasks.
- This tool gives the user each task they have to work on, with all the necessary data of the project, sequence, shot and task they have to do, it also includes data such as the notes they have left on each task and the necessary assets.
